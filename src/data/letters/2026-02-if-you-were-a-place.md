My Amore,

If you were a place, you wouldn’t be loud.

You wouldn’t be fireworks or chaos or something dramatic.

You would be that quiet café in the corner of the city.  
Warm lighting.  
Soft music.  
A seat by the window where the world feels slower.

You would be the place I go to breathe.

You would be the place where I don’t have to perform strength.  
Where I can just exist.

You would be the place where I can be peaceful.
Where everything is warm and hope exist.

And the funny thing is.  
You probably don’t even know you feel like that.

But you do.

You feel like safety. You are safety.
You are something steady in a world that moves too fast.

And if one day you ever doubt yourself.  
If you ever think you’re not enough.

Remember this.

There is someone out here who thinks you feel like home.

And that is not a small thing.

Yours,
Reina
