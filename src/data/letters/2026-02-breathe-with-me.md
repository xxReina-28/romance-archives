My Amore,

If today feels heavier than usual, pause for a moment.

Take one slow breath.
Then another.

And imagine me there with you. Close enough that you don’t have to explain anything. Just quietly holding you. My fingers brushing through your hair. No speeches. No fixing. Just warmth. Just us.

You don’t always have to be strong.
You don’t always have to carry everything perfectly.
You don’t always have to win every battle you step into.

Some days, simply staying is brave enough.

I admire you when you’re powerful and unstoppable.
But I adore you even more in your quiet trying. In the effort no one else sees. In the weight you carry without complaining.

So if the world forgot to tell you today, let me say it softly.

I am so proud of you.
Even on your slow days.
Especially on your slow days.

You don’t have to conquer loudly.
Conquer gently. Conquer steadily.
I’ll be right here. Cheering for you in the quiet.

Yours,
The girl who believes in you a little more than she probably should

P.S. You, my emperor, were never meant for ordinary things. Excellence follows you. Even when you don’t see it yet.
