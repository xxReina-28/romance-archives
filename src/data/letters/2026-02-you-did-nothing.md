My Amore,

I was going to accuse you of something dramatic.

Of stealing my attention.  
Of distracting me from important things.  
Of being dangerously charming on purpose.

But the worst part is this.

You weren’t even trying.

You just sit there. Existing. Working. Talking normally.  
And somehow I end up smiling at my phone like a teenager who just discovered feelings for the first time.

It’s actually very inconvenient.

I had a whole personality before you, you know.  
Independent. Strategic. Unbothered.

Now look at me. Soft.

And the most offensive part is that you don’t even know you’re doing it.

So if you ever feel ordinary.  
If you ever feel like you’re just another man going through his day.

Please understand something.

You are accidentally someone’s favorite part of the day.

Mine.

Now go back to being powerful and productive.  
I’ll just be here. Pretending I’m not affected.

Yours (slightly annoyed, mostly obsessed),
Reina
